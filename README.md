Base network and their new dapps
About Base Network
Base is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network developed by Coinbase, built on the Optimism Stack. It offers low-cost, fast, and secure transactions while maintaining Ethereum's decentralization and security. Base is designed to be a developer-friendly platform for building scalable dApps, making it a hub for DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more.
This repository focuses on:
Showcasing new and innovative dApps built on Base.

Providing tutorials, code samples, and documentation for developers.

Tracking the growth and adoption of the Base ecosystem.

Repository Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
Aggregate resources and examples of dApps on the Base network.

Provide a starting point for developers to build or integrate with Base dApps.

Foster community contributions to document and explore the Base ecosystem.
